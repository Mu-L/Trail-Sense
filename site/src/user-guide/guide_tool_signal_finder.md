The Signal Finder tool helps you find a place where you will have cell signal.

## Signals
Signals that your phone detects are displayed at the top of the list. You will see the following information:

- Network type
- Signal strength
- The estimated distance to the tower (if available). You can refresh this by toggling airplane mode on and off.
- The time that the signal was detected
- Whether you have full service or only emergency calls. Full service means the tower is for your provider.

## Cell towers
A list of nearby cell towers is displayed at the bottom of the list. These are approximate tower locations from OpenCelliD, Mozilla Location Service, and FCC Antenna Registrations and are typically within a mile or kilometer of the cell tower. You will see the following information:

- Distance from your location
- Direction from your location

You will also have the ability to navigate to or create a beacon for the tower by using the menu on the right side.

## Emergency calls
You should be able to place an emergency call as long as you have cell signal from any provider.

## Disclaimer
The accuracy of the tower locations may vary, and some towers may have been decommissioned or are inaccurate.
