Trail Sense is composed of a number of tools that are designed for hiking, backpacking, camping, and geocaching.

## Bottom navigation
The Navigation, Map, Weather (if available), and Astronomy tools are available in the bottom navigation bar by default. These tools are also available in the tool list.

You can change which tools (up to 7) appear in the bottom navigation in Settings > Tools > 'Bottom navigation slot'.

All other tools can be found in the Tools bottom navigation item on the far right.

## Tool list

## Pinned tools
You can pin tools to the top of the tool list by long-pressing on a tool and selecting 'Pin'. This will make the tool appear at the top of the tool list. You can unpin a tool by long-pressing on it and selecting 'Unpin'.

You can also pin/unpin tools in bulk by tapping the edit icon to the right of the pinned tools header.

## Sorting tools
You can change the order of the tools by clicking the sort icon to the right of the tools header. This will allow you to sort by:
- **Name**: Sorts alphabetically by tool name.
- **Category**: Groups tools by category and sorts alphabetically within each category.

## Search
You can search for a specific tool using the search bar at the top of the tool list. 

## User guide
A user guide is available for each tool. You can access the user guide by long-pressing on a tool and selecting 'User Guide'. You can also access the user guide by opening the 'User Guide' tool in the tool list.

## Settings
You can access the app settings by tapping the settings icon in the top right corner of the tool list. You can also access the settings by opening the 'Settings' tool in the tool list.

## Quick actions
You can enable quick actions at the top of the tool list in 'Settings > Tools > Quick actions'.

The quick actions can also be accessed by long pressing the bottom navigation. In addition to the quick actions you selected, you will also see contextual quick actions for the active tool, such as the user guide or settings.

You can find more information about each quick action by viewing the user guide for its respective tool. All quick actions that begin with 'Tool:' will open the tool when clicked.
