        Please consider posting in the New Feature Ideas [issue](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/issues/2590) or [discussion](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/discussions/316) instead of logging a new issue. If you do create a new issue, I may modify your description or create my own issue as a replacement to make it easier for development. Please search through existing issues to make sure this isn't a duplicate and be sure to follow the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/kylecorry31/Trail-Sense/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

      description: Include any background information that may be relevant to the feature request. This may include write-ups, links, algorithms, images, or videos that would be useful in the development of this new feature. If you are suggesting a feature that is mathematical in nature or believe a different algorithm is more accurate, please include trusted sources here so I can cross verify - I try to ensure that all features are backed by research and are well tested using real-world data.
